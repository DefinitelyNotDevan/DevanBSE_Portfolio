# Phone Controlled Robot Arm
My project is the Phone Controlled Robot Arm. This 3 joint arm uses servos to controll it and has a claw. It uses bluetooth to allow the phone to communicate with Arduino through an app.

# Final Milestone
My final milestone is the increased reliability and accuracy of my robot. I ameliorated the sagging and fixed the reliability of the finger. As discussed in my second milestone, the arm sags because of weight. I put in a block of wood at the base to hold up the upper arm; this has reverberating positive effects throughout the arm. I also realized that the forearm was getting disconnected from the elbow servo’s horn because of the weight stress on the joint. Now, I make sure to constantly tighten the screws at that joint.

# First Milestone
  

My first milestone was assembling my arm and connecting it to my Arduino. I recieved my pieces in the Lafvin 4DOF Smart Robot Mechanical Arm Kit and then built them using the guide that came with the kit. I had some trouble with screwing in screws into the servo flaps and screwing in lock nuts but I solved it by using a different screwdriver than what was in the box and also using a wrench to keep the lock nut in place while I screwed it in.
